# Book Library API - A Web API using Express, mySQL and Sequelize

This project is a Book Library API to store information about readers, books, genres and authorss. Here we implemented a CRUD REST API to interact with a MySQL database.

For this project, we fired up an instance of MySQL locally to use with our Express API.

Once our MySQL instance was set-up, we implemented a REST API to allow us to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) actions on readers, books, authors and genres.

This is a project completed as part of the Software Engineering FastTrack course at Manchester Codes.

## General info

 The project covered the following concepts:

* Web servers and web APIs - what they are and why we need them
* Creating a web server using Express
* HTTP requests and responses
* Routing
* Retrieving route params, query params and body params from HTTP requests
* Controller functions
* Middleware
* Databases
* Docker
* Database Design
* SQL
* MySQL
* Sequelize
* Database Querying and CRUD operations
* Using helper functions

## Technologies

* Node and Node Package Manager
* Chai, Mocha and Supertest for testing purposes
* Git & GitHub for version control
* Express for the server and routing
* nodemon for configuration purposes (it watches your modifications in the code and updates the server accordingly so that you don't need to reload the server everytime you make new changes)
* dotenv for configuration purposes (environment variables)
* mySQL (Structured Query Language)
* mysql2 and Sequelize for the database and the ORM that abtracts it
* Docker (provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container)
* eslint (eslint-config-airbnb-base, eslint-plugin-import) for code styling


## Languages

* JavaScript
* SQL
